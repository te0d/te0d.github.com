Expertise is an old Ruby on Rails application based on the "10,000 Hour Rule" which claims that it takes roughly 10,000 hours of doing anything to master it. While I do not take this at face value, I did and do believe putting time into a skill moves you toward mastery. During college when I created Expertise, I used it to keep track of some of my hobbies and past-times such as programming or reading.
