Before the COVID lockdown period, I'd often find myself playing tabletop games with friends, whether it be Settlers of Catan or Dungeons & Dragons. Under the new circumstances, we were no longer to regularly meet up in person. There are numerous online solutions to playing tabletop games, but I wanted something anyone can use for free without an account. And it was fun. So I made my own basic online shared tabletop. Users can place and move various tokens (I now have emoji support) and other users will see the board update in real-time.
