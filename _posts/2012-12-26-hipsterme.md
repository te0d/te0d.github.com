HipsterMe is a favorite of mine that I'd like to bring back eventually. It focuses on music, and the popularity of bands based on their statistics from last.fm. Users "bump" bands and invest in these bands with "cred" (sort of a Reddit karma situation). The "cred" of these users decreases or increases based on the change in popularity of the bands they "bump". The idea is to incentivize users to pick out new and upcoming bands. Users who do well gain more cred with which to invest. Other users can find new bands based on their friends' bumped bands or the quickest rising bands.
