When I was developing TrailMix, I noticed the wealth of languages available in OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia. I decided to create a Geography quiz game that leveraged the language data and thus formed Geografia. Geografia is a simple geography quiz game available in a variety of languages. The user interface language will change as well as the answers and region descriptions. For a handful of languages, I was able to get the displayed map to use the target language as well.
