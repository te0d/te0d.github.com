    <p>Hello again. I'm Tom and I come from, and live in, Northern NJ, USA.</p>

    <p>I've programmed as a hobby and professionally for over a decade. I am a full-stack developer who is happy to build an application from the database to the user interface.</p>

    <p>Some other activities I enjoy are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Climbing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Amateur Radio</li>
        <li>Electronics</li>
        <li>Foreign Language Learning</li>
        <li>Travel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On this homepage of mine, I put a spotlight on some of my programming projects. And I talk a bit about other things I enjoy in my writing.</p>

    <p>If you would like to contact me you can reach me at (replacing dots and ats with <code>.</code> and <code>@</code> accordingly, <strong>don't forget the first dot between my first and last name</strong>):</p>
