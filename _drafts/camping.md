So you want to go backpacking? The wilderness calls. But what do you need? The standard list is the [Ten Essentials](https://www.nps.gov/articles/10essentials.htm) which in short (roughtly in order of what I find important) is:

- Clothing
- Water
- Light
- Fire
- Food
- Shelter
- Maps
- First Aid
- Tools
- Sun Protection

These are the basics and what your priorities should be are dependent on where and when you plan to travel. These ten essentials are the minimum preparation required to keep you safe in adverse conditions. It's missing some "niceties" like a cooking stove which should also be included in any basic backpacking trip. You also have some leeway when you are travelling in a group. It is good to have backups of items like fire starters, but not everyone necessarily needs a full first aid kit in a group of four people.

Let's elaborate.

== Clothing ==

Clothing is the basis of your comfort and potentially your survival. It should keep you **warm and dry**, while not being overly cumbersome. Wool or synthetic clothing is the preferred material since it tends to be better at keeping you warm, even when wet. And when it is wet, wool and synthetic materials will typically dry faster.

How much clothing you bring is dependent on the season. I will wear the same base clothing each day and carry a basic backup in case I fall in a river or similar. Everything on top of that is layers which vary throughout the day and night. Walking uphill I strip layers until I pause at the peak or campsite to layer back up to keep warm. When I get into my sleeping bag at night, I take off my potentially damp outer layers and sleep in the base layers. **Bring an extra layer top and bottom for unexpected adverse conditions.**

Don't forget about footwear! Balance between waterproofness and breathability depending on the expected terrain. Make sure your boots fit comfortably, you'll be wearing them almost all the time.

And lastly, don't forget about rain. Getting soaked is a sure way to make you uncomfortable and could put you into a dangerous situation. Bring a rain jacket and consider rain pants.

== Water ==

Mmm, what monster doesn't love water? You'll die in only a few days without it.

You need a way to **hold water** and you need a way to **purify water**. How much water you bring is something very personal, so I recommend bringing too much until you have a good baseline. While it may be the heaviest thing you carry, it's better to have more than you need than not enough. As a minimum when I am confident I will be near sources of water, I will bring 2L (about a half gallon). I have also brought 5L before when water is scarce.

Two liters of water is rarely enough for a 3-day backpacking trip. That means you will need to find water on your route and purify it. There are a couple methods of water purification with their own benefits and drawbacks. I usually boil water using a stove I bring for cooking food. I also have water purification tablets I keep in my first aid kits for emergency situations or in times of poor preparation.

== Light ==

You don't want to be caught in the middle of the woods without a way to illuminate your surroundings. Especially if you don't yet have your camp set up. Since you may be setting up camp in the dark or cooking or anything, you'll want to have a headlamp so you can have both hands to do what you need to do. **Bring backup batteries!.** A headlamp with no batteries is no different from having no headlamp at all.

== Fire ==

Man's first discovery. I don't like to be overly reliant on fire because you may not have good wood around to create one. That said, it does make a good backup if you have shortcomings in the other essentials. It can help keep you warm, dry clothing (don't melt it), and be used to replace a stove for cooking or purifying water. In an emergency situation, it may be useful to draw attention to yourself via smoke. Most importantly for myself, I use it to light my camping stove.

Beside having a lighter on my person, I keep an additional lighter and matches in my waterproof first aid kit. Having a flint or similar device that can create sparks can also be used to ignite your cooking stove.

Also consider bringing some firestarter whether it be cottonballs in vaseline or little firestarter bricks. But be aware that you may be fighting an uphill battle with sufficiently soaked wood.

== Food ==

Mmm, food. What monster doesn't like food? You'll die after numerous days without food.

The amount of food you bring is another thing you'll need to figure out on your own. Bring more than you expect to need, since it is better to have too much than run out of food. When you think you have enough, bring an extra amount for emergency food. While you will survive much longer without food compared to without water, you don't want to feel powerless and hungry when you're trying to get out of the woods.

Keep in mind food preparation and how you will eat it. I recommend bringing food that can be eated without being cooked in emergency situations. While ramen tastes much better after boiling it and adding some toppings, you can still eat it dry if need be. You don't want to be caught with a pound of raw meat and no way to cook it. Also, dry food is lighter and can be cooked with water found along the route.

Food storage is also important to keep in mind. You don't want a hungry bear poking its nose in your tent while you are sleeping. Food should be either kept in a bear canister away from the camp or hung in a bag also away from the camp. Cooking food should also take place a distance from where you are sleeping.

== Shelter ==

In the ten essentials, this is listed as emergency shelter since that's what you need to survive. Since you are not planning on simply surviving but living, it is good to bring something to sheild you from the elements while sleeping. This can be a tent or a hammock or a tarp you use to build an A-Frame. A sleeping bag and a sleeping pad are also good basics to bring. The sleeping pad is especially important if the ground is cold since the pad will keep the ground from sucking off all of your heat. Also, it is more comfortable to sleep on the pad than on the ground.

== Maps ==

If you don't know where you are, you are going to have a bad time. Knowing where are is not simply having a map and compass but also knowing how to use them. Familiarize yourself with the area you will be travelling in and identify potential pitfalls like a missed trail junction. It really sucks when the sun is setting and you realize are not all all where you are supposed to be. If you don't have a way of identifying where you are and find yourself in an area unfamiliar, good luck!

== First Aid ==

Beside the extra water purification and fire making tools I keep in my first aid kit, it is useful to have ways to treat wounds and other ailments. More often than bandages, people need headache medicine or allergy medication. But more importantly than simply carrying a first aid kit, you need to know how to use it. Beyond carrying a first aid kit, it is important to be aware of the various hazards you may encounter and when to evacuate or get help. Expect the unexpected.

== Tools ==

Having a basic multitool or pocket knife can come in handy. Don't bring canned foods and not a can opener. Bring some rope to tie things to your pack. Have a way to cut open clothing to make something to tie together a some sticks to make a splint for someone who needs to hobble out of the woods.

== Sun Protection ==

While I put this at the bottom, I don't want to understate it's importance. You may be on a snowy field, but if the sun it strong it will burn you and make you weak. Have the appropriate sun screen as well as taking advantage of your clothing to keep yourself out of the sun's powerful rays. Sunglasses 

= Beyond the Ten Essentials =

Wow, that's not too much you might say. And it's not, but there's some basic other stuff you're going to want. You will need a **backpack** to carry the stuff. Like footwear, what you are using to carry everything can make or break your comfort as you backpack around the woods. The backpack should be comfortable, large enough to fit everything you needs, and keep your possesions dry.

If you are in bug country, some type of bug spray can be useful. At night and in your post backpacking shower, check yourself for ticks by feeling yourself up.

A bag for garbage and/or to hang your food for bears is useful.

For cooking, I like to bring a cooking stove as well as the fuel cannister it uses. Also utensils, plates, napkins, and the like are oft forgotten until you try to split your soup four ways by passing around the cooking pot.

Bear mace, a bell, or other noise making device can be useful to keep critters away while you are out and about.

A tarp is often useful for keeping things off the ground or keeping the ground and you try by hanging it up in the rain. In an emergency you can use it as a shelter.

== A Quick Note On Winter ==

Winter camping will involve more forethought. You can be constantly surrounded by cold, frozen water. This complicates things a bit but nothing you can't handle. Obviously you need to have some extra layers as well as a solid hat, balaclava, and gloves. A waterproof jacket and pants with gaiters will keep you dry.

An appropriately rated sleeping bag (the temperature they give is more of a "you won't die" temperature than a comforable temperature) and sleeping pad are what will prevent you from freezing all night.

Be aware of your water freezing overnight or your water hose freezing if you use a camelback. Keep you water bottles with you in your sleeping bag at night.


= In Conclusion =

It's a learning process. At first, don't go too far from your car. Walk the trails you plan to camp on during the day to scout out the area. Go for one night before on easy terrain you trek through the 100 Mile Wilderness. It's about having fun but also finding yourself in the face of adversity. Hopefully you come out learning a bit about yourself and the world you live in.
