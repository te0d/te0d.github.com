title: Tending to a Raspberry Farm

Not exactly a farm, but you know, a couple of raspberries to make a pi. In an effort to learn more about Linux system administration, I'm trying to follow IConrad's post detailing one path a sysadmin make take administrating multiple linux boxes. But I don't want to do it with virtual machines. Instead, raspberry pi's will be used for each VM he lists. What IConrad sets up is based on CentOS, and while I could install Fedora on the pi's to be able to use the same software, I'm going to modify the applicaions to whatever seems easist at the moment.

So instead of CentOS, I will be using ArchLinux ARM. And instead of Spacewalk, I will be using Puppet. Really I have no idea of the differences using Puppet will cause but we'll figure it out as we go. ;)
